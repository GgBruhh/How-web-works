1. What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol

2. What is a URL?
A URL is a link that will take you to the a specific webpage or document from the server

3. What is DNS?
Makes human readable URLs and turns them into IP addresses

4. What is a query string?
A query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL

5. What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET and POST. GET submits a request without changing the server, as POST does make a change to the server which typically requires you to be authenticated.

6. What is an HTTP request?
An HTTP request is the request typically made from the client-side browser to the server for the data.

7. What is an HTTP response?
An HTTP response is the response to the request made and it delivers the data back in the form of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, whichever progamming languages were used.

8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Contr

9. What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
The browser makes a request on the client side and the server sends a response with data with HTML and other languages to build the webpage, then the browser takes that response and displays it into something that can be interpreted.
